Does referee bias exist in the NBA?

In any competitive sport, the importance of having referees goes without saying. Referees exist to enforce rules so that games are played at a 
respectably fair level. However, at the end of the day, referees are humans and are prone to bias. This research aims to see if referee bias exists 
in the National Basketball Association (NBA). I consider factors like home bias, star-status player bias, ethnicity bias, etc for control variables
and use R to run logistic regressions with analysis on P-values on odd ratios to determine referee bias.
